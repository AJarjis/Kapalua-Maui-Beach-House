                                The Island of Maui is without a doubt the best place to be in Hawaii for whale watching from the shoreline.

                                or from a scenic lookout. See them from the sand, and be very careful if you are watching them as you are driving.

                            <p>
                                The sensation of striking a dew kissed drive into the morning Kapalua sun is, to the avid golfer, golf at its finest. Recognized
                                as one of the top golf resorts in the world, Kapalua’s two championship golf courses are nothing short of breath-taking.

                                Opened in 1979, the Kapalua Tennis Garden is sculpted out of lush tropical foliage with stunning views. The hillsides bloom 
                                in a profusion of colour, creating a perfect backdrop for the ten plexipave courts paired in tiered clusters; four lighted 
                                for night play. Each set of courts is secluded in landscaped privacy with its own viewing lanai.

                                country’s largest.
